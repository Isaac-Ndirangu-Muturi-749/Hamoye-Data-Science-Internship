    "This archive contains 2075259 measurements gathered between December 2006 and November 2010 (47 months).\n",

    "Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.(globalactivepower*1000/60 - submetering1 - submetering2 - submetering3) represents the active energy consumed every minute (in watt hour) in the household by electrical equipment not measured in sub-meterings 1, 2 and 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.The dataset contains some missing values in the measurements (nearly 1.25% of the rows). All calendar timestamps are present in the dataset but for some timestamps, the measurement values are missing: a missing value is represented by the absence of value between two consecutive semi-colon attribute separators. For instance, the dataset shows missing values on April 28, 2007.\n",

    "global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)\n",
    "submetering1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).\n",
    "submetering2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.\n",
    "submetering3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner."
