    "### Data Set Information:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Link:** [Individual Household Electric Power Consumption](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption)\n",
    "\n",
    "This archive contains 2,075,259 measurements gathered between December 2006 and November 2010 (47 months).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `(globalactivepower*1000/60 - submetering1 - submetering2 - submetering3)` represents the active energy consumed every minute (in watt-hour) in the household by electrical equipment not measured in sub-meterings 1, 2, and 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The dataset contains some missing values in the measurements (nearly 1.25% of the rows). All calendar timestamps are present in the dataset, but for some timestamps, the measurement values are missing. A missing value is represented by the absence of a value between two consecutive semi-colon attribute separators. For instance, the dataset shows missing values on April 28, 2007.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attribute Information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **date:** Date in format dd/mm/yyyy\n",
    "- **time:** Time in format hh:mm:ss\n",
    "- **globalactivepower:** Household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)\n",
    "- **globalreactivepower:** Household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)\n",
    "- **voltage:** Minute-averaged voltage (in volt)\n",
    "- **global_intensity:** Household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)\n",
    "- **submetering1:** Energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). Corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven, and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas-powered).\n",
    "- **submetering2:** Energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). Corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator, and a light.\n",
    "- **submetering3:** Energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). Corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner."
